A toolbox for implementing text in the gyri of a (real) brain surface reconstruction using a pretrained deep VGG-19 network.

In collaboration with Matt Siegelman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2018.

Dependencies:

tensorflow
opencv

After installing the dependencies:
Download the VGG-19 model weights (see the "VGG-VD models from the Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Visual Recognition project" section). More info about the VGG-19 network can be found here.
After downloading, copy the weights file imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat to the project directory.
